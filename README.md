I hacked parts of the Next186 VGA code for MiST to allow playing 320x200 games on DOS using 15 kHz PVMs "natively".

I say "natively", because obviously the number of scanlines is no longer the same and timings are different (60 Hz vs. 70 Hz). The games will still sync correctly (unless they do something really funny) so this is a great way to play DOS games on 15 kHz displays.

You need the .RBF, Next186.ROM and Next186.VHD at the root of the SD card.

I hacked parts of the Next186 VGA code for MiST to allow playing 320x200 games on DOS using 15 kHz PVMs "natively".

I say "natively", because obviously number of scanlines is no longer the same and timing are different (60 Hz vs. 70 Hz), etc.

You need the .RBF, Next186.ROM and Next186.VHD at the root of the SD card.
